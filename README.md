# Bitcoinz Wallets Questions

This repository exists solely to provide a means for community members to ask questions related to the wallet, and for other community members to provide answers. Doing so utilizing Github's issues allows the questions to be searchable so we don't have to answer the questions multiple times. In addition, issues being open until answered will allow us to ensure each question gets answered and none get overlooked.
